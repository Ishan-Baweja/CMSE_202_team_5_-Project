# CMSE_202_team_5_-Project

In simple terms, diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how a person's body turns food into energy. Although a lot of enviromental factors and eating habits are associated with Diabetes, it is unclear how Diabetes actually correlates with different trends of general health. Thus, this project sought to understand how diabetes relates to factors of general health such as BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other trends. Having an insight into this parameters helped us not only understand what factors seem to be highly correlating with Diabetes but also allow us to develop a model that predicts whether a person is prone to developing diabetes given to where they stand on these different trends. 



The data analysis was subdivided into three different datasets:


## Kaggle "Diabetes" Dataset



## The Center for Disease Control and Prevention
